This is a personal project that is based on two datasets about Netflix. One is a qualitative dataset, while the other is quantitative. Both datasets were chosen in-order to create more insights into how Netflix performed pre-covid and during covid, and the kind of content available on Netflix.
This dataset was downloaded from Kaggle, and this SQL Project is to determine the kind of content on Netflix between the years 2020 & 2021, Which country contributed the most to revenue and subscription during covid and what kind of content did they watch? And how covid affected their revenue and subscriber numbers.
